intro: 'Pottery is complicated. It is an art that requires creativity and a strong
  sense of design. It is also a science that requires a thorough understanding of
  natural materials and how they will react in combination with extreme heat. '

    - Each piece is a complexity of nature, science and art. It amazes me. There are
      an infinite number of creative possibilities. There are an endless number of decisions
      that are made to get from the organic materials to the finished piece of art.
    - And despite my best effort to control the variables that come together to form
      my art, nature always stamps unique and surprising finishing touches on each piece.
      There will always be a lack of complete control and this makes the process mystical.
    - All of these factors, the bounty of creative potential, and the limitless opportunity
      to learn and grow, have joined together to form my passion for this art. I hope
      that you enjoy my work.
