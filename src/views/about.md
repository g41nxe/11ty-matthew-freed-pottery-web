headline: About Matthew 

intro: "My love affair with clay began in the early 1990s when I began taking lessons at a local stoneware studio in Winnipeg.  Although there were some heavy duty sparks between us initially, we sadly parted ways when I moved to Montreal to study and then work in the marketing field."

      - "We toyed with the idea, but neither of us was into the long distance relationship thing at the time. We were young and not terribly interested in long-term commitments."
      - "I moved to Vancouver in 1998 and have since made it my home. It is here that I have gotten reacquainted, with pottery. We were casually seeing each other for a few years while I continued to work as a marketer."
      - "I kept pottery as a hobby but soon came to a realization that it was a passion that I wanted as a central fixture in my life. It was time to make a lifetime commitment to one another."

    paragraphs:
      - "It was a frightening leap to make, but I got down on one knee and we got engaged. Soon after we moved in together (a natural progression of our relationship), and have blossomed as a pair over the past 18 years."
      - "My how time flies. For the most part we still get along extremely well - but pottery can be somewhat unpredictable and moody - so we fight on occasion. But our foundation is strong and we always patch things up. Over the years weâ€™ve made so many friends who are kind enough to support us and appreciate us."
      - "We were even honored with a significant honour - the Gold Medal for Excellence in Craft by Circle Craft. So onward we proceed on this life journey together - slowly working our way to being old and gray and sitting on the front porch swing where we can reminisce about our long lifetime journey together."
